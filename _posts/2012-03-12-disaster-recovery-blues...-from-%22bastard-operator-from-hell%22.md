    The boss is going on about Disaster Recovery again, like the company's going to go to the wall 
    if one of the buildings collapses in an earthquake or something. My comment that an earthquake 
    during work hours might actually improve the company's performance did not generate the 
    expected chuckle of assent.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    One more for the seismic therapy in other words. And, as part of his enquiries, he wants to 
    inspect all our DR planning and see just how well prepared we are for the eventuality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I could tell him the truth, which is that we're about as prepared for disaster as Butch Cassidy 
    and the Sundance Kid, but that would cause a lot of very unnecessary concern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Not to put too fine a point on it, I told him a load of old bollocks. Certainly enough to satisfy 
    middle-management types in any case: "Oh well, we're completely prepared with off-site media 
    and media inventories - backup recovery plans, disaster recovery agreements with hardware 
    manufacturers, along with three 'cold-site' venues in our distant offices to run up a recovery 
    system in about 36 hours, give or take half a day or so," I burble.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "Add to that our redundant cabling links, agreements for emergency cable and satellite service 
    from the major carriers, the network side of the recovery would be the simplest part. The slowest 
    bit would be reading the tapes into the various server machines. Client and desktop machines 
    would be added on an as-needed basis, depending on the employees concerned and their 
    immediate importance to the company plan."
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "Excellent!" the boss cries, eyes shining with delight. "Well, I suppose all that's left is for a 
    quick tour of the facilities!"
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    So now I'm up a thinwire without a terminator. The boss is bound to find out sooner or later that 
    it's all bollocks and demand to know why.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The PFY notices my air of resignation (to having to listen to the boss rabbit on about 
    'professional integrity' and not job evacuation) and asks what the problem is. I fill him in on 
    all the sordid details.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "We could just take him to one of the cold site centres and tell him that they all look like that, 
    then get the off-site media bloke to say that they don't permit site visits," he suggests.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "The media guy might work, but the cold site's a goner."
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "Too cold to be fired up?" the PFY asks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "No, too hired out to other tenants."
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "What?!"
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    "Well, they're normally right in the heart of the business districts. So I usually rent the space 
    to some other company and pour the dosh to a more deserv

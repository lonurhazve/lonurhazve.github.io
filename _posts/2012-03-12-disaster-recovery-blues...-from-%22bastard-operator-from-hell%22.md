The boss is going on about Disaster Recovery again, like the  company's  going to go to the wall if one of the buildings collapses in  an  earthquake or something. My comment that an earthquake during work   hours might actually improve the company's performance  did not generate  the expected chuckle of assent. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
One more for the seismic therapy in other words. And,  as part of his enquiries, he wants to inspect all our DR planning and  see    just how well prepared we are for the eventuality. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I could tell him the truth, which is that we're about  as prepared for disaster as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but that     would cause a lot of very unnecessary concern. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Not to put too fine a point on it, I told him a load of  old  bollocks. Certainly enough to satisfy middle-management types in  any  case: "Oh well, we're completely prepared with off-site media and  media  inventories - back-up recovery plans, disaster recovery   agreements with hardware manufacturers, along with three 'cold-site'   venues in our distant offices to run up a recovery system in  about 36  hours, give or take half a day or so," I burble. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Add to that our redundant cabling links, agreements  for emergency cable and satellite service from the major carriers, the     network side of the recovery would be the simplest part. The slowest  bit would be reading the tapes into the various server     machines.  Client and desktop machines would be added on an as-needed basis,  depending on the employees concerned and    their immediate importance  to the company plan." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Excellent!" the boss cries, eyes shining with  delight. "Well, I suppose all that's left is for a quick tour of the  facilities!" </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So now I'm up a thinwire without a terminator. The  boss is bound to find out sooner or later that it's all bollocks and     demand to know why. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The PFY notices my air of resignation (to having to  listen to the boss rabbit on about 'professional integrity' and not job     evacuation) and asks what the problem is. I fill him in on all the  sordid details. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"We could just take him to one of the cold site  centres and tell him that they all look like that, then get the off-site  media    bloke to say that they don't permit site visits," he suggests.  </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"The media guy might work, but the cold site's a goner." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Too cold to be fired up?" the PFY asks. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"No, too hired out to other tenants." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What?!" </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Well, they're normally right in the heart of the  business districts. So I usually rent the space to some other company  and    pour the dosh to a more deserving project - in this case boosting  the bandwidth of the outgoing network connections." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Uncharacteristically altruistic of you," the PFY murmurs. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Yeah well...But it's all over now. He's bound to..." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Not necessarily!" the PFY shouts with satisfaction, with what looks like a glimmering of a plan in his eye. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Two days later, the boss joins me in the back of a  limousine for the trip to our site. "Bloody dark in here," the boss  mutters.    "Can't even see out the windows." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Yes," I ad lib. "This is a loaner from the Media Storage place - they take no precautions as they have important clients." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Oh," the boss utters smugly, self-importance boosted. "So, where are we going?" </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"We're going to the nearest site, which is about two hours away. I thought we'd tour one site a day if that's OK with you." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Two hours later we glide down a ramp into the  sub-basement parking area of the first DR centre. I help the boss into a  newly    refurbished freight elevator (security reasons) and we drop a  level to the DR centre. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Reminds me of somewhere," the boss mumbles, slightly more confused than his normal operating level. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"We got the DR centres to look familiar so that relocation and orientation is easier on the staff." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Really? That's quite a good idea!" </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We enter the DR computer room and have a quick look around. "It's a bit quiet isn't it?" the boss asks. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Well, cold sites are typically only fired up in an emergency - mainly to save power and maintenance costs." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Of course." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The rest of the tour goes smoothly and we make our way back to the office. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Where to tomorrow?" the boss asks. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I thought we might leave early and get to the Welsh Centre...pick you up at your place at 6am if that's OK." </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Once the boss has gone I tap on the driver's window. The PFY's visage appears as the smoked glass descends. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Wales tomorrow," I murmur. "Move the kit around a  bit, put some Welsh maps up with coloured pins at strategic points,     and leave a box of leeks in the freight elevator. Oh, and for Pete's  sake, get a bit more of the city in, will you? Two hundred    times  round the block is just asking for trouble!" </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Right, now to translate some machine names into imitation Welsh for the boss's edification (i.e Clomputhenay, etc.). </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This DR Stuff - it's all work, work, work! </div>

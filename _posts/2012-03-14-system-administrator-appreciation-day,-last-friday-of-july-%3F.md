<i>A sysadmin unpacked the server for this website from its box, 
installed an operating system, patched it for security, made sure the 
power and air conditioning was working in the server room, monitored it 
for stability, set up the software, and kept backups in case anything 
went wrong. All to serve this webpage.</i></div>

<i>A sysadmin installed the routers, laid the cables, configured the 
networks, set up the firewalls, and watched and guided the traffic for 
each hop of the network that runs over copper, fiber optic glass, and 
even the air itself to bring the Internet to your computer. All to make 
sure the webpage found its way from the server to your computer.</i></div>

<i>A sysadmin makes sure your network connection is safe, secure, open, 
and working. A sysadmin makes sure your computer is working in a healthy
 way on a healthy network. A sysadmin takes backups to guard against 
disaster both human and otherwise, holds the gates against security 
threats and crackers, and keeps the printers going no matter how many 
copies of the tax code someone from Accounting prints out.</i></div>

<i>A sysadminworries about spam, viruses, spyware, but also power outages, fires and floods.When the email server goes down at 2 AM on a Sunday, your sysadmin is paged, wakes up, and goes to work.</i></div>

<i>A sysadmin is a professional, who plans, worries, hacks, fixes, 
pushes, advocates, protects and creates good computer networks, to get 
you your data, to help you do work â€” to bring the potential of computing
 ever closer to reality.</i></div>
